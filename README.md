# Stock-Price-Predictor

This project was part of a tutorial, with the goal to predict Tesla's stock price with a neural network using keras.

The model selected was an LSTM network, with an 'adam' optimizer and the mean squared error as the loss function.

Predictions were then assessed using root mean squared error, with a score of 28.9
